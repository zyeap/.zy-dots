This site holds installation and setup documentation for my personal dotfiles! 

The machine I'm using a ThinkPad X220 with Arch Linux.

I'm using this site to learn static site deployment with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

**These dotfiles are intended to be used as a reference for others.   
Please do not use these dotfiles unless you are 100% sure about what the configuration does.**
